  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: The composition of the human intestinal microbiota
               is linked to health status. The aim was to analyze the
               microbiota of normal and colon cancer patients in order to
               establish cancer-related dysbiosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool
               bacterial DNA was extracted prior to colonoscopy from 179
               patients: 60 with colorectal cancer, and 119 with normal
               colonoscopy. Bacterial genes obtained by pyrosequencing of 12
               stool samples (6 Normal and 6 Cancer) were subjected to a
               validated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) test. The dominant
               and subdominant bacterial population (C. leptum, C. coccoides,
               Bacteroides/Prevotella, Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus
               groups, Bifidobacterium genus, and E. coli, and Faecalibacterium
               prausnitzii species) were quantified in all individuals using
               qPCR and specific IL17 producer cells in the intestinal mucosa
               were characterized using immunohistochemistry. FINDINGS:
               Pyrosequencing (Minimal sequence 200 nucleotide reads) revealed
               80\% of all sequences could be assigned to a total of 819 taxa
               based on default parameter of Classifier software. The
               phylogenetic core in Cancer individuals was different from that
               in Normal individuals according to the PCA analysis, with trends
               towards differences in the dominant and subdominant families of
               bacteria. Consequently, All-bacteria [log(10) (bacteria/g of
               stool)] in Normal, and Cancer individuals were similar
               [11.88$\pm$0.35, and 11.80$\pm$0.56, respectively, (P = 0.16)],
               according to qPCR values whereas among all dominant and
               subdominant species only those of Bacteroides/Prevotella were
               higher (All bacteria-specific bacterium; P = 0.009) in Cancer
               (-1.04$\pm$0.55) than in Normal (-1.40$\pm$0.83) individuals.
               IL17 immunoreactive cells were significantly expressed more in
               the normal mucosa of cancer patients than in those with normal
               colonoscopy. CONCLUSION: This is the first large series to
               demonstrate a composition change in the microbiota of colon
               cancer patients with possible impact on mucosal immune response.
               These data open new filed for mass screening and pathophysiology

               disease and ulcerative colitis result from alterations in
               intestinal microbes and the immune system. However, the precise
               dysfunctions of microbial metabolism in the gastrointestinal
               microbiome during IBD remain unclear. We analyzed the microbiota
               of intestinal biopsies and stool samples from 231 IBD and
               healthy subjects by 16S gene pyrosequencing and followed up a
               subset using shotgun metagenomics. Gene and pathway composition
               were assessed, based on 16S data from phylogenetically-related
               reference genomes, and associated using sparse multivariate
               linear modeling with medications, environmental factors, and IBD
               status. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae abundances
               were associated with disease status as expected, but also with
               treatment and subject characteristics. Microbial function,
               though, was more consistently perturbed than composition, with
               12\% of analyzed pathways changed compared with 2\% of genera.
               We identified major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, as well
               as decreased carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis
               in favor of nutrient transport and uptake. The microbiome of
               ileal Crohn's disease was notable for increases in virulence and
               secretion pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This inferred functional
               metagenomic information provides the first insights into
               community-wide microbial processes and pathways that underpin
               IBD pathogenesis.",
